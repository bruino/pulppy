## Pulppy*(beta)*
Linear Programming software for optimizing various practical problems of Operations Research.

## Features
It aims to resolve linear models with a intuitive, simple and multi platform graphical interface that deals with practical problems of Operative Research of "Integer", "Binary", "Continuous" and "Mixed" types.
The project has the following dependencies:

1. [PuLP](https://github.com/coin-or/pulp) PuLP is an LP modeler written in python. 
2. [PyQt5](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro) Qt is a cross-platform application development framework for desktop, embedded and mobile.
3. [Clp](https://projects.coin-or.org/Clp) The Computational Infrastructure for Operations Research (COIN-OR**, or simply COIN)  project is an initiative to spur the development of open-source software for the operations research community. 

## Origin
This software was made to accomplish a university project for the "Operative Research" course of the [Universidad Tecnológica Nacional - Facultad Regional Tucumán](frt.utn.edu.ar). For any questions or suggestions, reach me at: bruino.one[at]gmail.com
