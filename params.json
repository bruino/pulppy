  "body": "## **Features**\r\nIt aims to resolve linear models with a intuitive, simple and multi platform graphical interface that deals with practical problems of Operative Research of \"Integer\", \"Binary\", \"Continuous\" and \"Mixed\" types.\r\nThe project has the following dependencies:\r\n\r\n1. [PuLP](https://github.com/coin-or/pulp) PuLP is an LP modeler written in python. \r\n2. [PyQt5](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro) Qt is a cross-platform application development framework for desktop, embedded and mobile.\r\n3. [Clp](https://projects.coin-or.org/Clp) The Computational Infrastructure for Operations Research (COIN-OR**, or simply COIN)  project is an initiative to spur the development of open-source software for the operations research community. \r\n\r\n## **Download Free**\r\n-    [**Download**](https://github.com/bruino/pulppy/raw/master/Pulppy_Windows.zip) _Pulppy for Windows_\r\n\r\n## **Origin**\r\nThis software was made to accomplish a university project for the \"Operative Research\" course of the [Universidad Tecnológica Nacional - Facultad Regional Tucumán](http://www.frt.utn.edu.ar/).
